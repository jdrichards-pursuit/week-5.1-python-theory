# Key Correlations Between Pandas and AI/ML

You may be asking...
What do Pandas have to do with AI and Machine Learning?
Below is a list of how Pandas are commonly used in AI and Machine Learning.

## 1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

- **Impact:** Critical
- **Rationale:** Clean, well-structured data is fundamental to AI/ML model performance. Pandas excels at these tasks.
- **Examples:**
  - Handling missing values
  - Removing duplicates
  - Formatting data types

## 2. Feature Engineering

- **Impact:** High
- **Rationale:** Creating meaningful features often significantly improves model performance.
- **Examples:**
  - Creating lag features for time series
  - Binning continuous variables
  - Encoding categorical variables

## 3. Integration with AI Libraries

- **Impact:** High
- **Rationale:** Seamless data transfer between pandas and ML libraries streamlines workflows.
- **Examples:**
  - Converting DataFrames to numpy arrays for scikit-learn
  - Converting to TensorFlow tensors
  - Converting to PyTorch tensors

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Impact:** Medium to High
- **Rationale:** Understanding data characteristics informs model selection and feature engineering.
- **Examples:**
  - Visualizing distributions
  - Correlation analysis
  - Summary statistics

## 5. Time Series Analysis

- **Impact:** High (for time-based data)
- **Rationale:** Many AI applications involve time series data, where pandas' capabilities are particularly strong.
- **Examples:**
  - Resampling
  - Rolling windows
  - Lag operations
