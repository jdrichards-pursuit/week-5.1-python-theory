# Pandas: Powerful Data Analysis Library for Python

## What is Pandas?

Pandas is an open-source library for the Python programming language, designed for data manipulation and analysis. It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and tools for working with structured data.

## Key Features

1. **Data Structures**: Pandas introduces two primary data structures:

   - DataFrame: A 2-dimensional labeled data structure
   - Series: A 1-dimensional labeled array

2. **Data Import/Export**: Easily read and write data in various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, etc.)

3. **Data Cleaning**: Tools for handling missing data, merging datasets, and reshaping data

4. **Data Analysis**: Powerful grouping and aggregation functions for insightful analysis

5. **Time Series Functionality**: Extensive capabilities for working with date, time, and time-indexed data

6. **Performance**: Built on top of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (Numerical Python, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python), offering high performance for large datasets

## Why Use Pandas?

- **Simplifies Data Tasks**: Pandas makes complex data operations accessible with simple commands
- **Integrates Well**: Works seamlessly with other scientific Python libraries
- **Handles Big Data**: Efficiently processes large datasets
- **Flexible**: Suitable for various data science tasks, from simple data exploration to complex statistical modeling

## Common Use Cases

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Time series analysis
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning model preparation

# Pandas Basic Tutorial

This repository contains the code for the Pandas Basic Tutorial using customer data and a Pandas challenge using an employee performance dataset.

## Pandas Basic Tutorial

To learn about Pandas and basic concepts, got to the `pandas_basic_tutorial.ipynb` file. Follow the instructions in the file to complete the tutorial.

## Pandas Challenge

You will create functions to analyze the employee performance dataset.

Read the instructions in the `pandas_challenge.md` file to understand the challenge. Then place your code in the `pandas_challenge.py` file.

Good Luck!
