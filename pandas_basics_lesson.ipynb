    "### What is a DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional table with labeled rows and columns that can hold different types of data and can be resized. It is similar to a table in a database, an Excel spreadsheet. Each column in a DataFrame can contain different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings), and the DataFrame provides a variety of methods for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of a DataFrame include:\n",
    "- **Labeled axes**: Both rows and columns have labels, which makes it easy to access and manipulate data.\n",
    "- **Heterogeneous data**: Different columns can contain different types of data.\n",
    "- **Size-mutable**: You can add or remove columns and rows.\n",
    "- **Integrated operations**: Built-in methods for data manipulation, such as filtering, grouping, and aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, you can refer to the [Pandas documentation on DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html).\n",
